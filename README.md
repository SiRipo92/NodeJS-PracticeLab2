# IBM's Course on Node.js via Coursera

## Module 3 Hands-On Lab 2: Express Server

This project is part of IBM's Node.js course on Coursera. It involves creating an Express server to demonstrate middleware functionality, JWT-based authentication, and serving static content. This lab provides practical experience in configuring an Express server with middleware, securing it with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and rendering a static HTML page.

### Objectives

- Set up and run a basic Express server.
- Work with middleware functions to manage server requests.
- Implement JWT-based authentication middleware for protected routes.
- Serve a static HTML page from the Express server.

### Features

- **Express Server**: Configured and run as the core server for handling client requests.
- **Middleware Integration**: Various middleware functions to handle requests, log data, and manage authentication.
- **JWT Authentication**: Protects routes using JSON Web Tokens, ensuring secure access control.
- **Static HTML Page Rendering**: The server renders a static HTML page as part of the exercise.

### Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   npm install
2. **Tools Used**:
- Node.js & Express: For setting up the server and routing.
- JWT Authentication: Middleware for session-based access control.
- Postman & cURL: For testing API endpoints.
